{"name":"Playlist-scheduler","tagline":"Playlist-Scheduler for playing songs anytime you want","body":"#Playlist-Scheduler\r\n\r\nThis is an application for playing mp3 files according to a schedule. By using this java-written application you can play the songs anytime you want. This application can be used in schools, houses or other social activities that may require a song in a specific time.\r\n\r\nThis is one of my first projects. I hope you enjoy it. \r\n\r\n##How-to\r\nThe file named 'Playlist-Scheduler.jar' is an executable jar, which means you can simply start the application by using this file.\r\n\r\n1. Click Add Music\r\n2. Click on the music you added.\r\n3. Select a day to set the time.\r\n4. The textbox named 'S:' is for starting time.\r\n5. Set it to a specific time. (For example 12:24) \r\n6. Set a time for pause 'P:' textbox (For example 12:25)\r\n7. Click 'Set'\r\n8. The time is now set. The program will start playing the music when the time comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Notes\r\n- Program only supports mp3 files for now. That may be changed if needed in the future.\r\n- You have to click on the music after you add it in order to activate the menu.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nFatih AKTAS","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
