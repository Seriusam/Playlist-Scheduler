#Playlist-Scheduler

This is an application for playing mp3 files according to a schedule. By using this java-written application you can play the songs anytime you want. This application can be used in schools, houses or other social activities that may require a song in a specific time.

This is one of my first projects. I hope you enjoy it. 

Thank you,
